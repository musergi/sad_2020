In base upgraded, we can find the compulsory part of the practice and then each remaining folder has an extension.
Furthermore, in the tools folder, extra exercises (commented in class) can be found.

PRACTICA 2

In this folder, we have the first version of the code for this practice (in base). 
In the interface folder, we have an ordered and structured project with extensions and upgrades which were suggested. 

PRACTICA 3
==========
In the folder SelectorNIO a first, and basic version of the selector can be found. 
This code is improved in the full folder, which includes upgrades of the selector including a Swing interface.
The final practise, however, it is found in the new folder, which includes an improved interface using a panels system. 

PROYECTO

There is only one version of the project which has been considerably improved since the presentation day. 
It is organised in different folders which help the comprehension of the code.

ENJOY!
